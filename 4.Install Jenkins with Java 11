First, add the Jenkins repository to your system by importing its GPG key and creating a YUM repository file. You can do this by running the following commands:
cd /etc/yum.repos.d/
sudo wget -O /etc/yum.repos.d/jenkins.repo https://pkg.jenkins.io/redhat-stable/jenkins.repo
cd ~/Downloads
sudo rpm --import https://pkg.jenkins.io/redhat-stable/jenkins.io.key
Install Java 11 which is required for Jenkins:
sudo yum install java-11-openjdk
also, you can install sudo yum install java-1.8.0-openjdk-devel
Install Jenkins:
sudo yum install jenkins
By default, Jenkins listens on the port you specified in the configuration file. If you are running a firewall on your system, 
you will need to open this port to allow incoming traffic. You can do this by running the following command
sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --zone=public --add-port=8080/tcp
(or)
sudo firewall-cmd --add-port=8080/tcp --permanent
sudo firewall-cmd --reload
if you want to change the Port for Jenkins:
sudo vi /etc/sysconfig/jenkins
Find the line that starts with "JENKINS_PORT" and change the port number to the desired value. For example, to use port 9090, you would set the line to:
JENKINS_PORT="8080"
Note - After Changing the Port you have to run the above Firewall commands to allow incoming Traffic
Start the Jenkins service and enable it to start automatically at boot time by running the following commands:
sudo systemctl start jenkins
sudo systemctl enable jenkin
