To Allow RDP on CENTOS

Check if the EPEL repository is enabled on your system.
EPEL (Extra Packages for Enterprise Linux) is a repository that provides additional software packages for CentOS.
You can check if it is enabled by running the following command:

sudo yum repolist

If the EPEL repository is not listed, you can enable it by installing the epel-release package:

sudo yum install epel-release

Install XRDP:

sudo yum install xrdp

sudo firewall-cmd --zone=public --add-port=3389/tcp --permanent
sudo firewall-cmd --reload

sudo systemctl start xrdp
sudo systemctl enable xrdp
