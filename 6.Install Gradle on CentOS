Gradle is an open-source build automation system used primarily for Java projects. 
It combines the best features of Ant and Maven. 
Unlike its predecessors which use XML for scripting, Gradle uses Groovy , a dynamic, 
object-oriented programming language for the Java platform to define the project and build scripts.

The following sections provide information about how to install Gradle on CentOS 7. Weâ€™ll download the latest release of Gradle from their official website.
Install OpenJDK
Gradle requires Java JDK or JRE version 7 or above to be installed.
Install the OpenJDK 8 package with the following command:
sudo yum install java-1.8.0-openjdk-devel
Verify the Java installation by printing the Java version :
java -version
Download Gradle
At the time of writing this article, the latest version of Gradle is 8.1. Before continuing with the next step you should check the Gradle releases page to see if a newer version is available.
Start by downloading the Gradle Binary-only zip file in the /tmp directory using the following wget command:
cd ~/Downloads
wget https://services.gradle.org/distributions/gradle-8.1-bin.zip
sudo unzip gradle-8.1-bin.zip -d /opt/
Verify that the Gradle files are extracted by listing the /opt/gradle/gradle-5.0 directory:
ls /opt/gradle/gradle-8.1
nano ~/.bashrc
export PATH=$PATH:/opt/gradle-8.1/bin
source ~/.bashrc
Verify the Gradle installation
To validate that Gradle is installed properly use the gradle -v command which will display the Gradle version:
gradle -v
