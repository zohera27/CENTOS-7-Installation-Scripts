First, ensure that you have Python 2.7 and Python 3.6 installed on your system. You can check the versions of Python by running the following commands:
python --version
python3 --version
Note - PIP version will only support on Python 3.6 greater >>> versions
Next, download the pip installation script using the following commands for For Python 3.6:
curl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/pip/3.6/get-pip.py -o get-pip.py
sudo python3 get-pip.py
Finally, verify that pip is installed and working correctly for Python 3.6 by running the following command:
pip3 --version
To make your Python 3.6 installation with pip 21.3.1 as the default on CentOS 7, you can follow these steps:
Open the .bashrc file in your home directory using a text editor:
nano ~/.bashrc
Add the following lines at the end of the file:
export PATH=/usr/local/bin:$PATH
export PATH=/usr/local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/pip:$PATH
These lines will add /usr/local/bin and /usr/local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/pip to your $PATH environment variable, 
which will make the Python 3.6 version of pip and other executables installed in /usr/local/bin the default version
Reload your .bashrc file by running the following command:
source ~/.bashrc
Verify that the correct versions of Python and pip are now the defaults by running the following commands:
python3 --version
pip3 --version
